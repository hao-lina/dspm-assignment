## 1. Setting up a now GitHub repository
> The link to the GitHub repository for this exercise is <https://github.com/hao-lina/dspm-assignment>.

## 2. Getting to know the API

In order to make sure the API key does not show up in the code, I created a separate file called `key.R` and added it to `.gitignore` so it will not be uploaded to GitHub.

```{r}
# Source key from separate file

source("key.R")
```
